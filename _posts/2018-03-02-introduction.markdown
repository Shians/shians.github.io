This will be a blog where I try to document issues encountered during daily bioinformatics. In particular I would like to assemble knowledge on topics I feel are poorly covered by the official documentation and require significant digging through multiple help forums. There are also problems that don't appear to covered at all by anywhere and I feel that I chanced upon a solution.
