It has a focus on analysing RNA-sequencing data using the Bioconductor package limma. The F1000 paper ‘RNA-seq analysis is easy as 1-2-3 with limma, Glimma and edgeR’ was used as a guide for the later sessions. It is intended to be delivered over four 2.5 hour workshops at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research (WEHI). 0.1 Data files You can download and unzip the files using the following commands download.file(&quot;https://github.com/Shians/BaseR_Intro/raw/master/data/workshop_data.zip&quot;, &quot;workshop_data.zip&quot;) unzip(&quot;workshop_data.zip&quot;, exdir = &quot;data&quot;) unzip(&quot;data/Ses3_counts.zip&quot;, exdir = &quot;data/counts&quot;) 0.2 R Packages Extra packages are required for later sessions, these can be downloaded by the following commands if (!requireNamespace(&quot;BiocManager&quot;, quietly = TRUE)) install.packages(&quot;BiocManager&quot;) BiocManager::install(&quot;RNAseq123&quot;) Acknowledgements This course material was originally produced by Lucy Liu and later modified by Shian Su.
